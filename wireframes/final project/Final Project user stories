Final Project
Personas
Karen
Karen is looking for someone to design a flier for her birthday party. She went on the internet to look for designers. She sees my website and clicks on it. She looks for the portfolio section to take a look at my work. Karen likes the aesthetic of my work. She is excited and looks for an about section. The section gives a bit of info about me. My contact info is also in that section. She takes out a piece of paper and writes down my contact info. 
James 
James just graduated from college and he is starting up a business. He want to get his name out quickly. A friend tells him about my site. He takes a look at my site. He doesnâ€™t see too much branding work but he likes the work that he is seeing so far. He looks for my contact info and decides to contact me to see if I can create a logo for him.
